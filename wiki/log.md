## [2026-10-10] schema | v2: LLM Wiki becomes Stellan's Brain
- Stellan asked to clear the LLM Wiki demo and restructure it into three sections. Answers to clarifying questions: FlowPilot is the business, and ACE is Stellan's business assistant in Claude chats. The Apprentice is a product Stellan is building. The daily run-through is a morning check-in plus an end-of-day review. The old pages should be deleted.
- \- deleted the 15 demo pages (sources, entities, concepts, analyses) and 3 raw files (Karpathy idea file, qmd README, qmd code excerpts)
- ~ `CLAUDE.md` rewritten as v2: sections, `hub` and `daily` page types, morning and evening workflows, investing and business guardrails
- ~ `tools/wiki.py`: new page types, plus support for daily pages that link several raw files
- + [[investing-apprentice]], [[flowpilot]], [[ace]], [[daily-run-through]]
- ~ [[overview]] rewritten as the Stellan's Brain home page; [[index]] regrouped by section
- → The first morning check-in fills in the hubs' Open questions, one at a time
